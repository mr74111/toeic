This will be done floor by floor beginning on April 1. Affected offices will be temporarily relocated to another allocated space within the building. The affected floors, relocation schedule, and allocated space are as follows:<br> <table> <tr> <th>Floor</th> <th>Affected Period</th> <th>Allocated Space for Relocation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>April 1-10</td> <td>Second Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>April 11-20</td> <td>Third Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>April 21-30</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>May 1-9</td> <td>Fifth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>May 10-19</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> </table> It will be necessary to make new schedule changes as unexpected delays may occur. Departments with more staff will experience temporary overcrowding. We urge all visitors to these offices to come during normal operating hours before and after the renovations to avoid any inconveniences.<br> We want to express our thanks for your kind understanding and tolerance towards our staff during this unpleasant and inconvenient period.",

GEM Computers, a computer giant, sold its low-margin competitive desktop division. In recent years, GEM Computers has spent billions of dollars investing in the desktop division, where low-cost manufacturers have managed to stay at the top of the competition. However, GEM's desktop products have virtually stopped evolving and ceased making new products despite its heavy spending on R&D. This has caused the cash-stricken company to offer its loss-making division to Electronica. As one of the leading computer companies, Electronica paid $5 billion to buy the division. The market deems this as more favorable to GEM, as it received more than what it deserves for selling the division. It is expected to pay off most of its multimillion-dollar loans and avoid filing for bankruptcy for some time. Economists comment that GEM will start turning a profit as long as it keeps with its core products of mini computers and mainframe systems.",

      "passage": "<strong>Gaz International Sells Its Siberian Oil Operations to Local Company </strong><br><br> ZURICH - Yevgeni Stai, a mid -sized Russian oil company, has bought the Siberian oil and gas operations of Zurich-hased Gaz International. While no official figures have been released by either firm, the deal is believed to wui th in the vicinity of $145 million. <br> Until recently, Gaz International had been seeking to expand its exploration and refining operations, but it has reportedly been frustrated by local regulatory bodies. Gaz International shares rose by 1Â°/0 as news of the sale filtered into the media. <br> Yevgeni Star, which has some cross-share holdings with large industrial corporations in related and unrelated fields, notably in the energy and shipbuilding sectors, will become one of Russian's leading players in the vital strategic area of energy supplies. <br> Explaining the reasons for the sale, Gaz International CEO Fritz Faschier told reporters yesterday, 'Our board of directors believes that this is the ideal time to consolidate our operations by concentrating on lessrisky investments while at the same time boosting our interests in research and development. I mean, in particular, research into alternative fuels and energy sources. I have no doubt that this deal is in the interests of both parties.' <br> It is known that the deal includes significant technology transfers. A team of Gaz International engineers and administrators will train Yevgeni engineers in the operation of exploration and extraction technology developed by the international giant. <br> Yevgeni Star operators were also keen to acquire Gaz International's license to explore and develop northern oil fields until 2015. The current production of 10,000 barrels a day is expected to at least double over the next 5 years. <br> Due to the complex nature of legal arrangements surrounding the transfer of licenses and technological information, the deal is not expected to be sewn up before January of next year. Approval for the license transfer must be negotiated with Russian authorities while several major Swiss banks will vet the financial arrangements and the details of technology transfer.",

That was the reason for my cancellation request. However, it seems that my transfer has been postponed until next year, and I will stay here in Vancouver until then. As a long-time reader of the Channel Region Times, I would very much like to continue my subscription to the paper.<br> You have probably already processed the cancellation of my account. In this case, I assume I will have to open a new one. I have just looked at your website and I understand that there is a $25 sign-up fee for new subscribers. Although I realize that I was at fault for prematurely terminating our agreement, would you be willing to waive the standard start-up charge for my subscription? I hope you can make this exception for me considering my unique circumstances.

Occasional lockups with video games can happen from time to time and do not necessarily indicate a need for repair or replacement. However, if you are experiencing frequent lockups, please see the information below.<br> 1. Make sure you are using only licensed accessories. Unlicensed products and accessories do not undergo the Play Game testing and evaluation process.<br> 2. If a game freezes while playing, try unplugging the AC adapter from the back of the console, then check the air vents to make sure they're not being blocked. If your problem still persists, you may ship the console to our factory in New York for diagnosis by our team of specialists. If you determine that you must send your machine to the factory, please contact us so that we can assist you with a shipping label and further instructions.<br><br> Sincerely,<br> Ethan Davison<br> Technical Support Representative",

It has been determined that viruses and other security breaches have created the inadequate processing capacities. In an attempt to prevent further breaches, our computer technicians will install new security software, which will require the entire network to be temporarily off-line.<br> We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. If there are any concerns regarding this procedure, or if you have any other inquiries, please get in touch with me or your supervisor.<br><br> Alice Bergman<br> abergman@healthbuffs.org<br> 8654464<br><hr><br> To: bparker@healthbuffs.org<br> From: jcopland@healthbuffs.org<br> Subject: Network shutdown Date: Wednesday, April 4<br><br> Hi, Ben,<br><br> I'm writing in regard to Friday's shutdown of Health Buffs' computer network. Just so you know, I've already written Ms. Bergman to express my discontent at the lack of sufficient prior notice for this disruption<br> My team will be making a presentation at the annual Health Board meeting on Monday, April 9, at which health organizations from around the region will be attending. We're on schedule in terms of our research, but we were counting Friday as our last day to put together the information.<br> The disruption does not affect me because I have a computer at home, and I've downloaded the required information from our company's network. But there are two members of our team who do not have home computers, and they require the equipment on Friday to finish their preparations.<br> I'm hoping you will have a solution to this hurdle. Please let me know as soon as possible how we can rectify this problem.<br><br> Sincerely.<br> Janet Copland",

Your advertisement did not specify that a customer must sign up for a three-year contract before being eligible to receive this deal.<br> I decided to enter into the agreement anyway and drop my Priority Number service. When I received my first bill, I noticed that I had been charged with what you called a change of service fee for requesting the new package. In your advertisement, it specifically states that when switching from the Priority Number service to the Unlimited Incoming Calls, no start-up fee would be applied.<br> It is obvious to me that your advertisement campaign is intentionally misleading. In the first instance, your advertisement fails to mention even in small print the three-year stipulation. And in the second instance, the language is deceiving, and I believe, in violation of advertising laws<br> If I have misunderstood something that you feel you can clarify I am willing to consider an explanation. If I do not near anything from you, I will be filing a complaint.<br><br> Sincerely, Gaven McGuinty",
