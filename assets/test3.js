This will be done floor by floor beginning on April 1. Affected offices will be temporarily relocated to another allocated space within the building. The affected floors, relocation schedule, and allocated space are as follows:<br> <table> <tr> <th>Floor</th> <th>Affected Period</th> <th>Allocated Space for Relocation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>April 1-10</td> <td>Second Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>April 11-20</td> <td>Third Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>April 21-30</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>May 1-9</td> <td>Fifth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>May 10-19</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> </table> It will be necessary to make new schedule changes as unexpected delays may occur. Departments with more staff will experience temporary overcrowding. We urge all visitors to these offices to come during normal operating hours before and after the renovations to avoid any inconveniences.<br> We want to express our thanks for your kind understanding and tolerance towards our staff during this unpleasant and inconvenient period.",

      "passage": "<strong>Gaz International Sells Its Siberian Oil Operations to Local Company </strong><br><br> ZURICH - Yevgeni Stai, a mid -sized Russian oil company, has bought the Siberian oil and gas operations of Zurich-hased Gaz International. While no official figures have been released by either firm, the deal is believed to wui th in the vicinity of $145 million. <br> Until recently, Gaz International had been seeking to expand its exploration and refining operations, but it has reportedly been frustrated by local regulatory bodies. Gaz International shares rose by 1°/0 as news of the sale filtered into the media. <br> Yevgeni Star, which has some cross-share holdings with large industrial corporations in related and unrelated fields, notably in the energy and shipbuilding sectors, will become one of Russian's leading players in the vital strategic area of energy supplies. <br> Explaining the reasons for the sale, Gaz International CEO Fritz Faschier told reporters yesterday, 'Our board of directors believes that this is the ideal time to consolidate our operations by concentrating on lessrisky investments while at the same time boosting our interests in research and development. I mean, in particular, research into alternative fuels and energy sources. I have no doubt that this deal is in the interests of both parties.' <br> It is known that the deal includes significant technology transfers. A team of Gaz International engineers and administrators will train Yevgeni engineers in the operation of exploration and extraction technology developed by the international giant. <br> Yevgeni Star operators were also keen to acquire Gaz International's license to explore and develop northern oil fields until 2015. The current production of 10,000 barrels a day is expected to at least double over the next 5 years. <br> Due to the complex nature of legal arrangements surrounding the transfer of licenses and technological information, the deal is not expected to be sewn up before January of next year. Approval for the license transfer must be negotiated with Russian authorities while several major Swiss banks will vet the financial arrangements and the details of technology transfer.",

That was the reason for my cancellation request. However, it seems that my transfer has been postponed until next year, and I will stay here in Vancouver until then. As a long-time reader of the Channel Region Times, I would very much like to continue my subscription to the paper.<br> You have probably already processed the cancellation of my account. In this case, I assume I will have to open a new one. I have just looked at your website and I understand that there is a $25 sign-up fee for new subscribers. Although I realize that I was at fault for prematurely terminating our agreement, would you be willing to waive the standard start-up charge for my subscription? I hope you can make this exception for me considering my unique circumstances.

      "passage": "<strong>UK citizens donated a record $12 billion in 2006, up 28 percent from 2005.</strong><br><br> Analysts say that last year's flood in Central America was the main reason for the sharp increase. In November last year non-profit organizations around the country spent weeks collecting donations to contribute to the emergency aid effort in that region.<br> The flood aid was reminiscent of another recent catastrophe - the earthquake that struck Southeast Asia in 2004. Donations to charities rose dramatically that year in response to the call for emergency aid. However, donations then dipped slightly in 2005.<br> In contrast to the sharp rise in donations between 2005 and 2006, the number of people who donated money increased only one percent from the previous year. The Statistics Board reported that there were eight million donors nationwide in 2006. According to the Board, one household represents one donor.<br> Analysts say a steady inflation rate and an optimistic economic outlook helped to make mid-to-high income earners feel that they had more to donate.",

I believe there has been a mistake in the long-distance charges. I did not make any calls to Beijing, China, during the stated billing period, but I am being charged for 34 minutes' worth of call time.<br> The other long-distance charges specified in the bill are correct. My own records show that I made one long-distance call to Dublin on the date listed and one to London. I work as a freelance reporter for a number of English-language newspapers, which is why I have to make international calls. However, I have never worked for a Chinese paper, so I have never had the need to place a call to that country.<br> I would appreciate it if you could look into this issue and let me know the revised total of my bill.

Although I had booked a reservation, my girlfriend and I waited 25 minutes!!! This is a very long time considering I booked months in advance. Also, your wait staff was a little bit rude to me when I ordered. I am not fluent in French, but I try. I hope that you can address these issues, because your food is very good, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.<hr>To: David Carvey<dcarr@gmail.com><br> From: Jilles LeDuc <Jilles@leBistro.com><br> Date: June<br><br> Mr. Carvey,<br><br> My name is Jilles LeDuc, and I am the restaurant manager. I really appreciate the time you took to fill out our customer satisfaction survey. We take your comments very seriously and are working on the amount of time our customers have to wait before seating. I hope that you will come back soon as we have expanded our main dining room giving us 20 more tables. Next time you come, please be sure to say hello to me, and I will make sure you get a free dessert for you and your guest.<br> We will also be changing our menu a bit to include some new fare from the south of France. I think you will really enjoy it.<br> I hope you come back soon.<br><br> Jilles LeDuc<br> Le Bistro Lamoure Manager",
