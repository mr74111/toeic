This will be done floor by floor beginning on April 1. Affected offices will be temporarily relocated to another allocated space within the building. The affected floors, relocation schedule, and allocated space are as follows:<br> <table> <tr> <th>Floor</th> <th>Affected Period</th> <th>Allocated Space for Relocation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>April 1-10</td> <td>Second Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>April 11-20</td> <td>Third Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>April 21-30</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>May 1-9</td> <td>Fifth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>May 10-19</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> </table> It will be necessary to make new schedule changes as unexpected delays may occur. Departments with more staff will experience temporary overcrowding. We urge all visitors to these offices to come during normal operating hours before and after the renovations to avoid any inconveniences.<br> We want to express our thanks for your kind understanding and tolerance towards our staff during this unpleasant and inconvenient period.",

      "passage": "<strong>Gaz International Sells Its Siberian Oil Operations to Local Company </strong><br><br> ZURICH - Yevgeni Stai, a mid -sized Russian oil company, has bought the Siberian oil and gas operations of Zurich-hased Gaz International. While no official figures have been released by either firm, the deal is believed to wui th in the vicinity of $145 million. <br> Until recently, Gaz International had been seeking to expand its exploration and refining operations, but it has reportedly been frustrated by local regulatory bodies. Gaz International shares rose by 1°/0 as news of the sale filtered into the media. <br> Yevgeni Star, which has some cross-share holdings with large industrial corporations in related and unrelated fields, notably in the energy and shipbuilding sectors, will become one of Russian's leading players in the vital strategic area of energy supplies. <br> Explaining the reasons for the sale, Gaz International CEO Fritz Faschier told reporters yesterday, 'Our board of directors believes that this is the ideal time to consolidate our operations by concentrating on lessrisky investments while at the same time boosting our interests in research and development. I mean, in particular, research into alternative fuels and energy sources. I have no doubt that this deal is in the interests of both parties.' <br> It is known that the deal includes significant technology transfers. A team of Gaz International engineers and administrators will train Yevgeni engineers in the operation of exploration and extraction technology developed by the international giant. <br> Yevgeni Star operators were also keen to acquire Gaz International's license to explore and develop northern oil fields until 2015. The current production of 10,000 barrels a day is expected to at least double over the next 5 years. <br> Due to the complex nature of legal arrangements surrounding the transfer of licenses and technological information, the deal is not expected to be sewn up before January of next year. Approval for the license transfer must be negotiated with Russian authorities while several major Swiss banks will vet the financial arrangements and the details of technology transfer.",

Due to an unexpected change in my living situation, I would like to ask you to reverse that request.<br> Up until last Friday, I believed that my company was transferring me to Montreal. That was the reason for my cancellation request. However, it seems that my transfer has been postponed until next year, and I will stay here in Vancouver until then. As a long-time reader of the Channel Region Times, I would very much like to continue my subscription to the paper.<br> You have probably already processed the cancellation of my account. In this case, I assume I will have to open a new one. I have just looked at your website and I understand that there is a $25 sign-up fee for new subscribers. Although I realize that I was at fault for prematurely terminating our agreement, would you be willing to waive the standard start-up charge for my subscription? I hope you can make this exception for me considering my unique circumstances. Please bear in mind, also, that I have been a loyal customer of yours for several years.<br> Thank you for your help.<br><br> Sincerely,<br> Kern Ibach",

In November last year non-profit organizations around the country spent weeks collecting donations to contribute to the emergency aid effort in that region.<br> The flood aid was reminiscent of another recent catastrophe - the earthquake that struck Southeast Asia in 2004. Donations to charities rose dramatically that year in response to the call for emergency aid. However, donations then dipped slightly in 2005.<br> In contrast to the sharp rise in donations between 2005 and 2006, the number of people who donated money increased only one percent from the previous year. The Statistics Board reported that there were eight million donors nationwide in 2006. According to the Board, one household represents one donor.<br> Analysts say a steady inflation rate and an optimistic economic outlook helped to make mid-to-high income earners feel that they had more to donate.",

The entire pipeline will span 500 kilometers from the drilling rig to the processing facility.<br> Preliminary gas drilling is scheduled for January 2008, so the engineers on the project would like to have the pipes by the first of December 2007. To meet the deadline, the management at Bastion has decided that the East Coast factory will produce half of this order while our main plant in Chester will take care of the other half. As supervisor of the East Coast factory, you are responsible for keeping me apprised of the manufacturing progress.<br> We have already placed an order for the steel materials, which are due to arrive there early next week. Please inform me when the shipment has been delivered, at which time I would also like to propose a monthly manufacturing schedule.<br> <hr> To: jturner@bastion.com<br> From: pyoung@bastion.com<br> Subject: Shipment arrival<br> Date: January 18, 2007<br><br> Dear Mr. Turner,<br> I'm writing to inform you that the full steel shipment arrived at the plant this morning. I'm sure these materials will be sufficient for the first portion of the manufacturing.<br> With our factory's capacity, it will take approximately one month to manufacture 50 kilometers of steel pipe. Therefore, an order of 250 kilometers of 10-inch diameter pipe should take five months to complete.<br> After independent inspectors check the pipes, there is always the possibility that we will have to make modifications. Even if this is the case, we still have 11 months in total to complete the production, so I can guarantee we will be finished ahead of the December deadline.<br> In summary, our manufacturing goal is 50 kilometers of pipe per month, and I will send you an update on our progress on the 25th of every month. If there is any other specific information you would like, please let me know at your convenience.",

Unfortunately, instructions for assembling the bookshelf were not included in the shipment, and I was unable to put the bookshelf together because of this missing information. Please be aware that customers like myself rely on these instructions; it is nearly impossible to construct the furniture without them. I would appreciate it if you could mail me a copy of the instructions for the bookshelf (Item #42210) at your earliest convenience. Sending the instructions by e-mail would be even better. If you have the instructions available electronically, please send them to shardy@mail.com.<br> Another problem is with the total cost in the invoice since I believe the total is 10 dollars less than the stated amount. Could you check it as well and let me know what went wrong?<br> My order confirmation number is AXT921, and the order number is 442. Attached is the invoice that came with my order. I would like to be able to complete the assembly of my bookshelf as soon as possible, and would appreciate your prompt reply to this request. Please contact me at (901) 840-0982 if you have any questions.",

I believe there has been a mistake in the long-distance charges. I did not make any calls to Beijing, China, during the stated billing period, but I am being charged for 34 minutes' worth of call time.<br> The other long-distance charges specified in the bill are correct. My own records show that I made one long-distance call to Dublin on the date listed and one to London. I work as a freelance reporter for a number of English-language newspapers, which is why I have to make international calls. However, I have never worked for a Chinese paper, so I have never had the need to place a call to that country.<br> I would appreciate it if you could look into this issue and let me know the revised total of my bill. You can contact me at home at (490) 555-0923 or on my cell at 014-555-2990.<br><br> Thank you for your assistance,<br> David Batty<br> <hr> Prime Choice Telecommunications<br> Customer: David Batty<br> Account #: 30489000023<br> Billing Period: Sept. 1 - Sept. 30, 2007<br> Billing Period: Sept. 1 - Sept. 30, 2007<br> <strong>Charges</strong><br> Standard Home Phone Plan Monthly Charge: $24.99<br> State Tax: $1.67<br> Local Tax: $3.69<br> Long-distance Charges: $40.83<br> <strong>Total Owed: $71.18</strong><br> <strong>*Description of Long-distance Charges:</strong><br> 09/18: Dublin, Ireland, 48 min - $13.05<br> 09/27: Beijing, China, 34 min - $23.60<br> 09/30: London, England, 12 min - $3.18<br> <strong>Questions?</strong> Contact Customer Service at customerservice@primechoice.com or write to us at: Customer Service Department<br> Prime Choice Telecommunications<br> 2901 Gallagher Highway, Building 4B<br> Wellsville, VA",

      "passage": "<strong>Cross-cultural Communication in Business Negotiations</strong><br> <em>Business Weekly by Dr. Rod Steiner November 2006</em><br><br> The importance of effective cross-cultural communication during business conferences or negotiations is often unappreciated. And yet it is not just the immediate outcome of the negotiation which is at stake but also the possibility of a positive, ongoing business relationship.<br> Here's simple example: 'don't mix business with pleasure,' we say, thinking ourselves to be efficient and 'virtuous.' But trying to negotiate with that attitude in some other cultures may well cause consternation in your host. This in turn will result in cross-cultural irritation and may well put the future relationship under a cloud. So, the first rule should be to study the culture of the people with whom you are going to negotiate.<br><br> Dr. Rod Steiner,<br> assistant lecturer,<br> Department of Business Studies, South Australia Institute of Technology.<hr>South Australian Institute of Technology<br> Department of Business Studies<br> 44 Berwick St<br> Adelaide, Australia 5066<br> November 24, 2006<br><br> Dear Dr. Steiner,<br><br> I read your article Cross – Cultural Communication in Business Negotiations with a great deal of interest. I am a postgraduate language/business student at the University of Adelaide, and I have also had some experience living and studying in Japan.<br> You are absolutely right when you highlight possible “cross cultural irritation”. In our culture, we would never associate business transactions of any type with drinking alcohol and going to nightclubs. However, that’s more or less the normal way of doing things in Japan.<br> I hope to specialize in this area of study – I mean, in cross-cultural communication – and that’s why I have chosen also to study some foreign languages. If you have any suggestions for further reading, could you please let me know?<br><br> Thanks for your attention.<br> Julie Luddon",
