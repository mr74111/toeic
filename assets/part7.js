This will be done floor by floor beginning on April 1. Affected offices will be temporarily relocated to another allocated space within the building. The affected floors, relocation schedule, and allocated space are as follows:<br> <table> <tr> <th>Floor</th> <th>Affected Period</th> <th>Allocated Space for Relocation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>April 1-10</td> <td>Second Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>April 11-20</td> <td>Third Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>April 21-30</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>May 1-9</td> <td>Fifth Floor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>May 10-19</td> <td>Fourth Floor</td> </tr> </table> It will be necessary to make new schedule changes as unexpected delays may occur. Departments with more staff will experience temporary overcrowding. We urge all visitors to these offices to come during normal operating hours before and after the renovations to avoid any inconveniences.<br> We want to express our thanks for your kind understanding and tolerance towards our staff during this unpleasant and inconvenient period.",

      "passage": "GEM Computers has topped the Wall Street headlines with its organization-wide restructuring exercise. GEM Computers, a computer giant, sold its low-margin competitive desktop division. In recent years, GEM Computers has spent billions of dollars investing in the desktop division, where low-cost manufacturers have managed to stay at the top of the competition. However, GEM's desktop products have virtually stopped evolving and ceased making new products despite its heavy spending on R&D. This has caused the cash-stricken company to offer its loss-making division to Electronica. As one of the leading computer companies, Electronica paid $5 billion to buy the division. The market deems this as more favorable to GEM, as it received more than what it deserves for selling the division. It is expected to pay off most of its multimillion-dollar loans and avoid filing for bankruptcy for some time. Economists comment that GEM will start turning a profit as long as it keeps with its core products of mini computers and mainframe systems.",

      "passage": "<strong>Gaz International Sells Its Siberian Oil Operations to Local Company </strong><br><br> ZURICH - Yevgeni Stai, a mid -sized Russian oil company, has bought the Siberian oil and gas operations of Zurich-hased Gaz International. While no official figures have been released by either firm, the deal is believed to wui th in the vicinity of $145 million. <br> Until recently, Gaz International had been seeking to expand its exploration and refining operations, but it has reportedly been frustrated by local regulatory bodies. Gaz International shares rose by 1°/0 as news of the sale filtered into the media. <br> Yevgeni Star, which has some cross-share holdings with large industrial corporations in related and unrelated fields, notably in the energy and shipbuilding sectors, will become one of Russian's leading players in the vital strategic area of energy supplies. <br> Explaining the reasons for the sale, Gaz International CEO Fritz Faschier told reporters yesterday, 'Our board of directors believes that this is the ideal time to consolidate our operations by concentrating on lessrisky investments while at the same time boosting our interests in research and development. I mean, in particular, research into alternative fuels and energy sources. I have no doubt that this deal is in the interests of both parties.' <br> It is known that the deal includes significant technology transfers. A team of Gaz International engineers and administrators will train Yevgeni engineers in the operation of exploration and extraction technology developed by the international giant. <br> Yevgeni Star operators were also keen to acquire Gaz International's license to explore and develop northern oil fields until 2015. The current production of 10,000 barrels a day is expected to at least double over the next 5 years. <br> Due to the complex nature of legal arrangements surrounding the transfer of licenses and technological information, the deal is not expected to be sewn up before January of next year. Approval for the license transfer must be negotiated with Russian authorities while several major Swiss banks will vet the financial arrangements and the details of technology transfer.",

Due to an unexpected change in my living situation, I would like to ask you to reverse that request.<br> Up until last Friday, I believed that my company was transferring me to Montreal. That was the reason for my cancellation request. However, it seems that my transfer has been postponed until next year, and I will stay here in Vancouver until then. As a long-time reader of the Channel Region Times, I would very much like to continue my subscription to the paper.<br> You have probably already processed the cancellation of my account. In this case, I assume I will have to open a new one. I have just looked at your website and I understand that there is a $25 sign-up fee for new subscribers. Although I realize that I was at fault for prematurely terminating our agreement, would you be willing to waive the standard start-up charge for my subscription? I hope you can make this exception for me considering my unique circumstances. Please bear in mind, also, that I have been a loyal customer of yours for several years.<br> Thank you for your help.<br><br> Sincerely,<br> Kern Ibach",

I made the purchase because one of the advertised strengths of Play Game is its ability to perform smoothly. However, games freeze while playing, and this happens very frequently.<br> I would prefer to solve the problem myself using your website, and I am perfectly competent to do so. Unfortunately, your website does not have a solution to this particular problem. I contacted the store where I purchased this game console, but the technicians there have been unable to provide me with assistance. Any information and suggestions you can offer in solving this problem would be much appreciated.<br><br> Faithfully,<br> Joan Shelton<br> <hr> <br>From: Ethan Davison <edavison@play_game.com><br> To: Joan Shelton jshelton@webuser.com<br> Date: March 9, 2:48 p.m.<br> Re: Game Console Problem<br><br> Dear Ms. Shelton,<br><br> I have thoroughly reviewed the issue you reported with your Play Game console. Occasional lockups with video games can happen from time to time and do not necessarily indicate a need for repair or replacement. However, if you are experiencing frequent lockups, please see the information below.<br> 1. Make sure you are using only licensed accessories. Unlicensed products and accessories do not undergo the Play Game testing and evaluation process.<br> 2. If a game freezes while playing, try unplugging the AC adapter from the back of the console, then check the air vents to make sure they're not being blocked. If your problem still persists, you may ship the console to our factory in New York for diagnosis by our team of specialists. If you determine that you must send your machine to the factory, please contact us so that we can assist you with a shipping label and further instructions.<br><br> Sincerely,<br> Ethan Davison<br> Technical Support Representative",

Your advertisement did not specify that a customer must sign up for a three-year contract before being eligible to receive this deal.<br> I decided to enter into the agreement anyway and drop my Priority Number service. When I received my first bill, I noticed that I had been charged with what you called a change of service fee for requesting the new package. In your advertisement, it specifically states that when switching from the Priority Number service to the Unlimited Incoming Calls, no start-up fee would be applied.<br> It is obvious to me that your advertisement campaign is intentionally misleading. In the first instance, your advertisement fails to mention even in small print the three-year stipulation. And in the second instance, the language is deceiving, and I believe, in violation of advertising laws<br> If I have misunderstood something that you feel you can clarify I am willing to consider an explanation. If I do not near anything from you, I will be filing a complaint.<br><br> Sincerely, Gaven McGuinty",

In November last year non-profit organizations around the country spent weeks collecting donations to contribute to the emergency aid effort in that region.<br> The flood aid was reminiscent of another recent catastrophe - the earthquake that struck Southeast Asia in 2004. Donations to charities rose dramatically that year in response to the call for emergency aid. However, donations then dipped slightly in 2005.<br> In contrast to the sharp rise in donations between 2005 and 2006, the number of people who donated money increased only one percent from the previous year. The Statistics Board reported that there were eight million donors nationwide in 2006.

The entire pipeline will span 500 kilometers from the drilling rig to the processing facility.<br> Preliminary gas drilling is scheduled for January 2008, so the engineers on the project would like to have the pipes by the first of December 2007. To meet the deadline, the management at Bastion has decided that the East Coast factory will produce half of this order while our main plant in Chester will take care of the other half. As supervisor of the East Coast factory, you are responsible for keeping me apprised of the manufacturing progress.<br> We have already placed an order for the steel materials, which are due to arrive there early next week. Please inform me when the shipment has been delivered, at which time I would also like to propose a monthly manufacturing schedule.<br> <hr> To: jturner@bastion.com<br> From: pyoung@bastion.com<br> Subject: Shipment arrival<br> Date: January 18, 2007<br><br> Dear Mr. Turner,<br> I'm writing to inform you that the full steel shipment arrived at the plant this morning. I'm sure these materials will be sufficient for the first portion of the manufacturing.<br> With our factory's capacity, it will take approximately one month to manufacture 50 kilometers of steel pipe. Therefore, an order of 250 kilometers of 10-inch diameter pipe should take five months to complete.<br> After independent inspectors check the pipes, there is always the possibility that we will have to make modifications. Even if this is the case, we still have 11 months in total to complete the production, so I can guarantee we will be finished ahead of the December deadline.<br> In summary, our manufacturing goal is 50 kilometers of pipe per month, and I will send you an update on our progress on the 25th of every month. If there is any other specific information you would like, please let me know at your convenience.",

Unfortunately, instructions for assembling the bookshelf were not included in the shipment, and I was unable to put the bookshelf together because of this missing information. Please be aware that customers like myself rely on these instructions; it is nearly impossible to construct the furniture without them. I would appreciate it if you could mail me a copy of the instructions for the bookshelf (Item #42210) at your earliest convenience. Sending the instructions by e-mail would be even better. If you have the instructions available electronically, please send them to shardy@mail.com.<br> Another problem is with the total cost in the invoice since I believe the total is 10 dollars less than the stated amount. Could you check it as well and let me know what went wrong?<br> My order confirmation number is AXT921, and the order number is 442. Attached is the invoice that came with my order.

      "passage": "<strong>Cross-cultural Communication in Business Negotiations</strong><br> <em>Business Weekly by Dr. Rod Steiner November 2006</em><br><br> The importance of effective cross-cultural communication during business conferences or negotiations is often unappreciated. And yet it is not just the immediate outcome of the negotiation which is at stake but also the possibility of a positive, ongoing business relationship.<br> Here's simple example: 'don't mix business with pleasure,' we say, thinking ourselves to be efficient and 'virtuous.' But trying to negotiate with that attitude in some other cultures may well cause consternation in your host. This in turn will result in cross-cultural irritation and may well put the future relationship under a cloud. So, the first rule should be to study the culture of the people with whom you are going to negotiate.<br><br> Dr. Rod Steiner,<br> assistant lecturer,<br> Department of Business Studies, South Australia Institute of Technology.<hr>South Australian Institute of Technology<br> Department of Business Studies<br> 44 Berwick St<br> Adelaide, Australia 5066<br> November 24, 2006<br><br> Dear Dr. Steiner,<br><br> I read your article Cross – Cultural Communication in Business Negotiations with a great deal of interest. I am a postgraduate language/business student at the University of Adelaide, and I have also had some experience living and studying in Japan.<br> You are absolutely right when you highlight possible “cross cultural irritation”. In our culture, we would never associate business transactions of any type with drinking alcohol and going to nightclubs. However, that’s more or less the normal way of doing things in Japan.<br> I hope to specialize in this area of study – I mean, in cross-cultural communication – and that’s why I have chosen also to study some foreign languages. If you have any suggestions for further reading, could you please let me know?<br><br> Thanks for your attention.<br> Julie Luddon",

Although I had booked a reservation, my girlfriend and I waited 25 minutes!!! This is a very long time considering I booked months in advance. Also, your wait staff was a little bit rude to me when I ordered. I am not fluent in French, but I try. I hope that you can address these issues, because your food is very good, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.<hr>To: David Carvey<dcarr@gmail.com><br> From: Jilles LeDuc <Jilles@leBistro.com><br> Date: June<br><br> Mr. Carvey,<br><br> My name is Jilles LeDuc, and I am the restaurant manager. I really appreciate the time you took to fill out our customer satisfaction survey. We take your comments very seriously and are working on the amount of time our customers have to wait before seating. I hope that you will come back soon as we have expanded our main dining room giving us 20 more tables. Next time you come, please be sure to say hello to me, and I will make sure you get a free dessert for you and your guest.<br> We will also be changing our menu a bit to include some new fare from the south of France. I think you will really enjoy it.<br> I hope you come back soon.<br><br> Jilles LeDuc<br> Le Bistro Lamoure Manager",
